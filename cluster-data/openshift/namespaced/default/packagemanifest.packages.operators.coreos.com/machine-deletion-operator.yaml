            failed node.  The MDR operator watches for them to be created, looks up
            the Machine CR and deletes Node associated with it.  MDR CRs are deleted
            by NodeHealthCheck when it sees the Node is healthy again.

      description: This operator conforms to the External Remediation API of NodeHealthCheck
        and is designed to work with Node Health Check to reprovision unhealthy nodes
        using the Machine API. It functions by following the annotation on the Node
        to the associated Machine object, confirms that it has an owning controller
        (e.g. MachineSetController), and deletes it. Once the Machine CR has been
        deleted, the owning controller creates a replacement.
