          Knative components build on top of Kubernetes, abstracting away the complex details and
          enabling developers to focus on what matters. Built by codifying the best practices
          shared by successful real-world implementations, Knative solves the "boring but difficult"
          parts of deploying and managing cloud native services so you don't have to.

        ## Knative Serving
           Knative Serving builds on Kubernetes to support deploying and serving of
           applications and functions as serverless containers. Serving is easy to get
           started with and scales to support advanced scenarios. Other features
           includes:
           - Rapid deployment of serverless containers
           - Automatic scaling up and down to zero
           - Routing and network programming
           - Point-in-time snapshots of deployed code and configurations

        ## Knative Eventing
           Knative Eventing is a system that is designed to address a common need for cloud native
           development and provides composable primitives to enable late-binding event sources and
           event consumers.
           Knative Eventing is designed to address a common need for cloud native development:
           - Services are loosely coupled during development and deployed independently
           - A producer can generate events before a consumer is listening, and a consumer
              can express an interest in an event or class of events that is not yet being
              produced.
           - Services can be connected to create new applications
              * without modifying producer or consumer, and
              * with the ability to select a specific subset of events from a particular
                producer.
