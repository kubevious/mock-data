      description: "Network Service Mesh (NSM) is a novel approach solving complicated
        L2/L3 use cases in Kubernetes that are tricky to address with the existing
        Kubernetes Network Model. Inspired by Istio, Network Service Mesh maps the
        concept of a Service Mesh to L2/L3 payloads as part of an attempt to re-imagine
        NFV in a Cloud-native way!\nThe Network Service Mesh Operator is a tool to
        install and manage the Network Service Mesh application.\nwhich is a novel
        approach solving complicated L2/L3 use cases in Kubernetes that are tricky
        to address with the existing Kubernetes Network Model. Inspired by Istio,
        Network Service Mesh maps the concept of a Service Mesh to L2/L3 payloads
        as part of an attempt to re-imagine NFV in a Cloud-native way!\nTo  better
        understand the network service meshes take a look at networkservicemesh.io.\nThe
        operator is a single pod workload that automates operational human knowledge
        behind the scenes to create the service mesh infrastructure components deploying
        a webhook and daemonsets with the network service managers and forwarding
        plane workloads taking the configuration from the Custom Resource manifest
        created specifically to be used with the operator. It aims to be platform
        independed and for such should run well in any kubernetes distribution.\nThe
        only requirement is that you create the nsm namespace for it in your platform.
        For manual installation check instructions on github.com/acmenezes/nsm-operator\nFor
        now it has only the Basic Install feature.\nSome of the features intended
        to be embedded with the operator in the future are\n* Installing, configuring
        and making cleanups if needed\n* Upgrading, backing up and restoring any important
        state information\n* Expose and aggregate metrics from all components through
        prometheus/grafana\n* Operations analytics based on metrics exposed   \n*
        Auto-pilot functions such as distributing NSM registry into multiple pods
        according to the size of the cluster among other functions that may be addressed
        as well via automation. \n\n"
