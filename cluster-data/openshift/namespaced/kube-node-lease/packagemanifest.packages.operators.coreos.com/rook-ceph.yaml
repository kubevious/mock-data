        The Rook-Ceph storage operator packages, deploys, manages, upgrades and scales Ceph storage for providing persistent storage to infrastructure services (Logging, Metrics, Registry) as well as stateful applications in Kubernetes clusters.

        ## Rook-Ceph Storage Operator

        Rook runs as a cloud-native service in Kubernetes clusters for optimal integration with applications in need of storage, and handles the heavy-lifting behind the scenes such as provisioning and management.
        Rook orchestrates battle-tested open-source storage technology Ceph, which has years of production deployments and runs some of the worlds largest clusters.

        Ceph is a massively scalable, software-defined, cloud native storage platform that offers block, file and object storage services.
        Ceph can be used to back a wide variety of applications including relational databases, NoSQL databases, CI/CD tool-sets, messaging, AI/ML and analytics applications.
        Ceph is a proven storage platform that backs some of the world's largest storage deployments and has a large vibrant open source community backing the project.

        ## Supported features
        * **High Availability and resiliency** - Ceph has no single point of failures (SPOF) and all its components work natively in a highly available fashion
        * **Data Protection** - Ceph periodically scrub for inconsistent objects and repair them if necessary, making sure your replicas are always coherent
        * **Consistent storage platform across hybrid cloud** - Ceph can be deployed anywhere (on-premise or bare metal) and thus offers a similar experience regardless
        * **Block, File & Object storage service** - Ceph can expose your data through several storage interfaces, solving all the application use cases
        * **Scale up/down** - addition and removal of storage is fully covered by the operator.
        * **Dashboard** - The Operator deploys a dashboard for monitoring and introspecting your cluster.
