        # Hazelcast Platform Operator #

        Easily deploy Hazelcast clusters and Management Center into Kubernetes environments and manage their lifecycles.

        ## Before You Start

        If you are planning to create Hazelcast Platform Enterprise clusters, you need to [create a secret](https://docs.hazelcast.com/operator/latest/get-started#step-2-start-the-hazelcast-cluster) for the license. You can request a trial license key from [here](https://trialrequest.hazelcast.com).

        For Hazelcast Platform clusters, you can simply continue.

        ## Documentation

        1. [Get started](https://docs.hazelcast.com/operator/latest/get-started) with the Operator.
        2. [Connect to the cluster from outside Kubernetes](https://guides.hazelcast.org/hazelcast-platform-operator-expose-externally/main)
          from the outside.

        ## Features

        Hazelcast Platform Operator supports the features below:

        * Custom resource for Hazelcast Platform (Open Source & Enterprise) and Management Center
        * Observe status of Hazelcast and Management Center clusters
        * Scale up and down Hazelcast clusters
        * Expose Hazelcast cluster to external
          clients ([Smart & Unisocket](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/clients/java#java-client-operation-modes))
