        ## About the managed application

        There is no managed application created with this operator.

        ## About this Operator

        The metering operator watches pods for predetermined labels, across a cluster or namespace(s).
        The label schema for Red Hat Application Services is in the format:

        * `com.company=Red_Hat`
        * `rht.comp=PAM`
        * `rht.comp_ver=7.10`
        * `rht.prod_name=Red_Hat_Process_Automation`
        * `rht.prod_ver=7.11`
        * `rht.subcomp=rhpam-kogito-runtime`
        * `rht.subcomp_t=application`

        It's important not to remove labels as the operator will cease monitoring those pods.

        The operator exposes a metric named: `appsvcs_cpu_usage_cores`
        The metric has a label for product category, these are Runtimes, Integration and Automation.
        There is a prometheus rule using the metric to group by product name, `appsvcs_cores_by_product:sum`.

        The operator utilises the OpenShift Monitoring Stack to provide usage observability via cloud.redhat.com

        ## Prerequisites for enabling this Operator
