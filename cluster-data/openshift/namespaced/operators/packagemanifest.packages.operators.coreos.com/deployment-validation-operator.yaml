      description: "The Deployment Validator Operator(DVO) checks deployments and
        other resources against a curated collection of best practices.\nThese best
        practices focus mainly on ensuring that the applications are fault-tolerant.\n\n###
        Configuration\n To configure the checks Operator runs or to run your own custom
        checks, you can use a  ConfigMap created in the **same namespace** as operator
        itself. ConfigMap should be named as  *deployment-validation-operator-config*
        and contain *deployment-validation-operator-config.yaml* as data. [Example](https://github.com/app-sre/deployment-validation-operator/blob/master/deploy/openshift/configmap.yaml)\n
        \n### Metrics\nDVO will report failed validations via Prometheus metrics.
        All the metrics are gauges that will report `1` if the best-practice has failed.\nThere
        is  [Instruction](https://github.com/app-sre/deployment-validation-operator#install-dashboard)
        to install a simple grafana dashboard."
