      description: "## Apache Cassandra\n\nThe Apache Cassandra database is the right
        choice when you need scalability and\nhigh availability without compromising
        performance. Linear scalability and\nproven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware
        or cloud infrastructure make it the\nperfect platform for mission-critical
        data. Cassandra's support for replicating\nacross multiple datacenters is
        best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind
        of knowing that you can survive regional outages.\n\n## DataStax Enterprise\n\nThe
        most advanced distribution of Apache Cassandraâ„¢ on the market, with the\nenterprise
        functionality needed for serious production systems and backed up and\nsupported
        by the best distributed-experts in the world. It's one platform for\nall types
        of applications anywhere, any cloud, any model: key-value, graph,\ntabular,
        JSON.\n\nDataStax Enterprise is a fully integrated and optimized database,
        with graph,\nanalytics, and search included, all with a unified security model.
        Simply put,\nit's the only database capable of meeting today's demanding requirements\n\n##
        Operator Details\n\n`cass-operator` is designed as a modular operator for
        Apache Cassandra and\nderived  distributions. Apache Cassandra is a distributed
        database consisting of\nmultiple nodes working in concert to store data and
        process queries along a\nnumber of fault domains. `cass-operator` has the
        deployment of a Cassandra\ncluster around the logical domain of a datacenter
        with the `CassandraDatacenter`\ncustom resource.\n    \nUpon submission of
        one of these resources it handles provisioning the underlying\nstateful sets
        (analogous to C\\* logical racks), services, and configuration.\nAdditionally
        through monitoring pod state via Kubernetes callbacks it handles day to day\noperations
        such as restarting failed processes, scaling clusters up, and deploying\nconfiguration
        changes in a rolling, non-disruptive, fashion.\n    \nThis operator is designed
        to be `Namespace` scoped. A single Kubernetes cluster may\nbe running multiple
        instances of this operator, in separate namespaces, to support\na number of
        C\\* clusters and environments. Configuration is simple with the usage of\nYAML
        based overrides in the Custom Resource paired with an `init` container.\n
        \   \nIn C\\* clusters ordering and timing of certain operations are important
        to keep the system\nevenly distributed. `cass-operator` takes advantage of
        a sidecar process within the\nmain container to handle the orchestration of
        starting our main C* process."
