        Kubestone is a benchmarking Operator that can evaluate the performance of Kubernetes installations and external services.

        Features:
        - Supports common set of benchmarks to measure: CPU, Disk, Network and Application performance
        - Fine-grained control over Kubernetes Scheduling primitives: Affinity, Anti-Affinity, Tolerations, Storage Classes and Node Selection
        - Cloud Native: Benchmarks runs are defined as Custom Resources and executed in the cluster using Kubernetes resources: Pods, Jobs, Deployments and Services.
        - Extensible: New benchmarks can easily be added by implementing a new controller.
