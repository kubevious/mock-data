        ##What's the Jenkins Operator?
        Jenkins operator is a Kubernetes native operator which fully manages Jenkins on Kubernetes. It was built with immutability and declarative configuration as code in mind.

        Out of the box it provides:

        integration with Kubernetes
        pipelines as code
        extensibility via groovy scripts or configuration as code plugin
        security and hardening
        Problem statement and goals
        The main reason why we decided to implement the Jenkins Operator is the fact that we faced a lot of problems with standard Jenkins deployment. We want to make Jenkins more robust, suitable for dynamic and multi-tenant environments.

        Some of the problems we want to solve:
        installing plugins with incompatible versions or security vulnerabilities
        better configuration as code
        lack of end to end tests
        handle graceful shutdown properly
        security and hardening out of the box
        orphaned jobs with no jnlp connection
        make errors more visible for end users
        backup and restore for jobs history
