      description: |-
        The Vitess Operator deploys and manages instances of MySQL with Vitess, a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL
        through generalized sharding.


        By encapsulating shard-routing logic, Vitess allows application code and
        database queries to remain agnostic to the distribution of data onto
        multiple shards. With Vitess, you can even split and merge shards as your
        needs grow, with an atomic cutover step that takes only a few seconds.


        Vitess has been a core component of YouTube's database infrastructure since
        2011, and has grown to encompass tens of thousands of MySQL nodes. For more
        information, visit [https://planetscale.com](https://planetscale.com)

        ### New Features

        We have support for Orchestrator, backups, and restores from GCS and S3. We also have seamless upgrades for all containers.

        ### Supported Features

        * **Dashboard** - The Operator deploys a dashboard for monitoring and introspecting your cluster.

        * **Scale Gateways** - Scale out the Gateway, which is the component that responds to queries and returns consolidated results from the MySQL shards.

        * **Configure Keyspaces** - Configure how your data is sharded with in your cluster.

        ### Before You Start

        1. Create a RedHat registry image pull secret called
        `planetscale-operator-pull-secret`, which is required to pull the operator
        image.

        2. Create an etcd cluster, which is used as a lock server by PlanetScale Vitess clusters. Try out the [etcd Operator](https://www.operatorhub.io/?keyword=etcd).

        ### Permissions

        This operator only supports running in the same namespace as the PsCluster resources it is watching.


        This operator should be deployed in an isolated namespace since the Pods it creates use the `default` service account and require the `use` permission on the `anyuid` Security Context Contraint (SCC) to run correctly. Running this operator in a shared namespace is not recommended since unrelated pods will have access to use the `anyuid` SCC.
