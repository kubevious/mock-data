        **The open source, self-hosted and cloud-native fault injection platform**

        ## Introduction

        Pystol is a fault injection platform represented as a Software Product Line to analyze the effects caused by a wide spectrum of adverse conditions.
        In particular, this software platform is designed for running on top of cloud-native environments without the distinction of its usage in private or public clouds.
        The tool is modular enough to be extended as an Ansible collection enabling users to create their own actions without any dependency with the framework.

        Including fault injection actions in the production infrastructure allows companies to have consistent environments, improve applications dependability against
        unexpected failures, provide better user experience, and an overall improvement of the system's quality.
        Using pystol, we enable cloud-computing technologies together with development teams to rapidly create complex systems and deploy them continuously, at global scale.

        ## Documentation

        Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.pystol.org)
        website for any information related to the project.

        ## CI dashboard

        Pystol uses **GitHub actions**
        and **badges** to run all the CI
        tasks, the result of running these
        tasks is represented using badges.

        In particular we embrace the use of
        CI dashboard as information radiators.

        We created the [badgeboad project](https://badgeboard.pystol.org)
        to show the value of any set of badges as a dashboard.

        For more information you can open the
        [CI dashboard](https://badgeboard.pystol.org)
        directly or go to the
        [project page in GitHub](https://github.com/pystol/badgeboard).

        ## Container images

        All pystol official container images are hosted in Quay.io under
        the [Pystol organization](https://quay.io/organization/pystol).

        There you will find two repositories:

        * The Pystol [staging repository](https://quay.io/repository/pystol/pystol-operator-staging).
        Here you will find all the container images from the upstream end-to-end jobs from the GitHub
        Actions jobs.

        * The Pystol [stable repository](https://quay.io/repository/pystol/pystol-operator-stable).
        Here you will find all the container images from the stable branches.

        ## License

        Pystol is open source software
        licensed under the [Apache license](LICENSE).

        ## Requirements

        * When installing Pystol, create and use the **pystol** namespace.

        ## Accessing the native web user interface.
        * If the user wants to access the native Pystol's UI, create a route in the cluster pointing to the Pystol's service.
