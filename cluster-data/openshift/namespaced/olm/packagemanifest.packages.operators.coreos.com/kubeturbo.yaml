        ### Application Resource Management for Kubernetes
        Turbonomic AI-powered Application Resource Management simultaneously optimizes performance, compliance, and cost in real time.
        Software manages the complete application stack, automatically. Applications are continually resourced to perform while satisfying business constraints.

        Turbonomic makes workloads smart — enabling them to self-manage and determines the specific actions that will drive continuous health:

        * Continuous placement for Pods (rescheduling)
        * Continuous scaling for applications and  the underlying cluster.

        It assures application performance by giving workloads the resources they need when they need them.

        ### How does it work?
        Turbonomic uses a container — KubeTurbo — that runs in your Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift cluster to discover and monitor your environment.
        KubeTurbo runs together with the default scheduler and sends this data back to the Turbonomic analytics engine.
        Turbonomic determines the right actions that drive continuous health, including continuous placement for Pods and continuous scaling for applications and the underlying cluster.
