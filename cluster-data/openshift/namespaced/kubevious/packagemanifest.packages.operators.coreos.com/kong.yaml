        Kong is a popular open-source cloud-native API gateway. Kong Operator is a Kubernetes operator which manages [Kong](https://konghq.com/kong/) and [Kong Enterprise](https://konghq.com/products/kong-enterprise/) clusters.

        Kong Operator can deploy Kong in various configurations, for example:
        * as a [Kubernetes ingress controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller), enabling you to expose Kubernetes `Service`s via Kong,
        * a standalone Kong gateway (without the ingress controller; either DB-enabled or DB-less)
        * a standalone Ingress Controller (configuring an external instance of Kong)

        Those configurations are further described in the [_Deployment Options_](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.8.0/helm-charts/kong/README.md#deployment-options) section of documentation.

        ### Quick Start

        The [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.8.0/README.md#quick-start) uses Kong Operator to deploy
        our recommended Kong setup for Kubernetes users (Kong DB-less with Ingress Controller), which includes an instance of Kong
        serving as a proxy to an example Kubernetes service.

        ### Documentation

        The primary documentation site for Kong Operator is located [in its GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.8.0/README.md).

        Kong Operator provides the same configuration flexibility as the Kong Helm chart.
        Refer to the [Helm chart documentation](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.8.0/helm-charts/kong/README.md),
        the [Configuration](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.8.0/README.md#configuration) section of Kong Operator docs, and the example `Kong` resource below.

        ### Upgrading from versions 0.8.0 and earlier

        0.9.0 changes the operator CRD to comply with Kubernetes requirements. Upgrades require manual work to move configuration into the new CRs.
        See the [0.9.0 upgrade guide](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#upgrading-from-previous-versions)
        for steps to upgrade past 0.8.0.
