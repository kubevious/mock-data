      description: "Kubevious is an app-centric assurance, validation, and introspection
        platform for Kubernetes. It helps running modern Kubernetes applications without
        disasters, and costly outages by continuously validating application manifests,
        cluster state and configuration. Kubevious detects and prevents errors(_typos,
        misconfigurations, conflicts, inconsistencies_) and violations of best practices.
        Our secret sauce is based on the ability to validate across multiple manifests
        and looking at the configuration from the application vantage point. Kubevious'
        unique app-centric user interface delivers intuitive insight, introspection
        and troubleshooting tools for cloud-native applications. It works right out
        of the box and only takes a couple of minutes to get Kubevious up and running
        for existing production applications. Kubevious operates inside the cluster
        with the user interface accessible as a web app and a CLI tool for integration
        with CI/CD pipelines.\n\n## \U0001F482 Guard\nKubevious Guard is a CLI extension
        that validates changes for conflicts, misconfigurations, typos, and violations
        of best practices before they are applied to Kubernetes clusters and have
        a chance to cause application outage or health degradation. It examines changes
        as a whole package, not as individual YAML manifests, allowing detection of
        cross-manifest violations and conflicts. Kubevious Guard follows [Built-in
        Validations](https://kubevious.io/docs/built-in-validators/) and an extensible
        [Rules Engine](https://kubevious.io/docs/features/rules-engine/) to execute
        the validation logic.\n\nChanges are validated by piping manifests YAML and
        can be easily integrated into the CI/CD pipeline testing stage. Remember that
        Kubevious should be deployed in the cluster.\n\nLearn more about Kubevious
        Guard in this [blog post](https://kubevious.io/blog/post/kubevious-guard-kubernetes-validation-enforcer).\n\n![Kubevious
        Guard Intro](https://github.com/kubevious/media/raw/master/videos/guard-intro.gif)\n\n##
        \U0001F441Ô∏è Observe\nKubevious analyses Kubernetes cluster configuration and
        state and presents it graphically into multiple domain-focused views. You
        can learn more about [Kubevious UI here](https://kubevious.io/docs/features/application-centric-ui/).\n</a>.\n\n-
        **Logic View** is focused on app-centricity, where container, compute, networking,
        storage, and RBAC related manifests correlated and grouped under Application
        nodes.\n- **Image View** is focused on container images and container image
        repositories used in the cluster.\n- **Gateway View** provides visibility
        regarding how applications are exposed to the public using Ingresses and API
        Gateways.\n- **RBAC View** identifies how Users and Groups are used in the
        cluster.\n- **Package View** provides visibility to Helm charts installed
        in the Kubernetes cluster.\n\n![Cluster and Configs in an Application Centric
