        ## About this Operator

        Appranix helps you to securely backup and restore, perform a disaster
        recovery and migrate Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster resources and persistent
        volumes.

        The operator works with Appranix to:

        - Install and initiate Appranix controller on your cluster

        - Take backups of your cluster and restore it in case of loss.

        - Migrate cluster resources to other clusters.

        - Replicate your production cluster to development and testing clusters.

        ## Prerequisites

        - A storage bucket in GCP or AWS & credentials to access it
        - Appranix token generated for your cluster from the Appranix console
        - A Configmap and Secret in your cluster for the bucket config and credentials

        #### Step 1: Creating a storage bucket

        Note: Currently only Google Storage bucket is supported, support for AWS Elastic Bucket Store will be available in a future release.

        - You can create a bucket through the GCP console or by running the following command in [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/)

        ```shell
        AX_CPS_BUCKET_NAME=<bucket_name>
        gsutil mb -b on gs://$AX_CPS_BUCKET_NAME/
        gcloud iam service-accounts create appranix --display-name "Appranix service account"
        AX_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list --filter="displayName:Appranix service account" --format 'value(email)')
        gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:$AX_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL:objectAdmin gs://${AX_CPS_BUCKET_NAME}
        gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ax_service_account.json --iam-account $AX_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
        ```


        #### Step 2: Obtaining the Appranix token for the cluster

        - Log in to your Appranix console and create a cluster. After the cluster creation copy the token generated for that cluster.

        #### Step 3: Creating the Configmap and Secret in the cluster

        A Configmap and Secret which contains the credetianls and bucket configuration has to be created before instaling the operator. It can be done by running the following command against your cluster.

        Note: Replace **token**, **bucket_name**, **bucket_provider** accordingly.


        ```shell
        AX_TOKEN=<token>
        AX_CPS_BUCKET_NAME=<bucket_name>
        AX_CPS_BUCKET_PROVIDER=<bucket_provider>
        AX_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(cat ax_service_account.json | base64 -w 0)
        # Run only for a Kubernetes cluster
        curl -Ls -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://us-central1-appranix-dev-07.cloudfunctions.net/gen-setup  -d '{"token": "'$AX_TOKEN'", "bucket": "'$AX_CPS_BUCKET_NAME'", "cloud": "'$AX_CPS_BUCKET_PROVIDER'", "secret": "'$AX_SERVICE_ACCOUNT'"}' | kubectl apply -f -
        # Run only for an OpenShift cluster
        curl -Ls -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://us-central1-appranix-dev-07.cloudfunctions.net/gen-setup  -d '{"token": "'$AX_TOKEN'", "bucket": "'$AX_CPS_BUCKET_NAME'", "cloud": "'$AX_CPS_BUCKET_PROVIDER'", "secret": "'$AX_SERVICE_ACCOUNT'"}' | oc apply -f -
        ```

        **After performing the above prerequisites you can proceed to install the Appranix Operator from OperatorHub**
